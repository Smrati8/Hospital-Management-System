# Hospital-Management-System

This project is aimed to automate the hospital management system. This project is developed
mainly to administrate doctor's appointment with the patients. The purpose of the project entitled
as HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is online website and android application to store staff
information, for taking online appointments, feedback etc. form. It was done by people for the
management and maintenance of the critical information. The current system requires numerous
paper works, so multiple copies of the same information exist in the hospital and it leads to
inconsistencies in data in various data stores and also leads to misplacement of important data. So,
we are developing the website which will help them to reduce these redundancies and will provide
them with smooth functioning with their web interface.
We provide with a system that can more accurately save the data of patients and staff allow the
user to easily book appointment with the doctors. The doctors will also be notified immediately
about any kind of booking being done in their accounts.

The objective of “Hospital Management System” is to easily track the information of all the staffs,
patients, treatment provided, and prescription and also for online appointment. The main goal of
the system is to build a good management tool to reduce the time taken through manual system in
order to maintain all the records.


# Following are the objectives providing by proposed system:

i. Providing them a website to work more efficiently.

ii. Providing easy access to doctors as well as patients.

iii. Scheduling the appointment of patients with doctors to make it convenient for both.

iv. Easy handling of hospital work online rather than doing it on papers or registers i.e. to
computerize all the information of patient and employees.

v. To have immediate storage of information.

vi. Navigation to hospital.

vii. To computerize all the information of patient and employees.

viii. We aim on making a system that a system that provides data which is perfectly organized
and well managed. We have provided with the information that is completely accurate and
does not disturb any kind of working.

ix. As the work done by people is manually so the system can be full of errors the
computerized system will further enhance the accuracy of the project and hence making
the project more reliable and efficient.

x. The system is very reliable as it has been tested through all the case and provides a very
large efficiency in comparison to that of the given system. The work from the manual
culture system will shift to computerized system which is faster and reliable.

xi. While the offline system of hospital, they use record or documents to store information of
patients or staff which is time complex, it wastes time. So for checking any kind of existing
document they have to manually search all the documents which is very time consuming.
Since the proposed system uses the MySQL as the database to store information, so the
procedure of data retrieval becomes much faster as compared to manual procedures of
retrieving the required information etc.

xii. The system we aim to make is to reduce the amount of cost that is being utilized by other
system already present in the industry.

xiii. To promote the development of high quality of hospital care in the community and the
country so as to provide a satisfactory environment to the patient and also to the doctors
for clinical research. To aware the user about the hospital and technologies used by them.

xiv. In today’s world the system, the records are maintained manually in different formats and
documents, there is no system to check the security in the existing work done, which result
in loss of important data and many of the documents are lost. So it is very important to
secure data, which is being completed by the project made by us. As in today’s world we
need security as a main purpose for implementing any logic so as to keep it safe. Thus we
need to authenticate the user for using or accessing the data of the hospital management
system and for that we provide a USERNAME & PASSWORD to the admin and user so
to keep the data safe.

xv. The system aim is providing a system which is easy to use for the user, the user involved
is performing the least work and hence the user can easily use the system.

xvi. The proposed system aims at minimizing redundancy of patient’s information.
